            <div class="intro">Beets are my favorite vegetable. They offer such a unique and wonderful flavor to these muffins. These don’t have any refined sugar and they’re vegan if using an egg replacer! They’re sweetened with maple syrup, mashed banana, and orange juice.
                The fruits give the muffins a rich and full flavor. After these little beauties have softened, you can chop them in a food processor if you’d rather not hand mash them.

                <ol>
                    <li>Cut beets into quarters and place in a pot of boiling water and cook until fork tender. Drain and let cool in colander. Place on a plate, cut off the skin, chop into small pieces, and measure out 1 cup. </li>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F / 200 degrees C. Line a cupcake tin with 12 liners or spray with cooking spray.
                    </li>
                    <li>While the beets boil, measure out the dry ingredients. In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir thoroughly.
                    </li>
                    <li>In a medium sized bowl, add orange juice, mashed banana, maple syrup, and oil. Mix until smooth and add the beaten egg. Stir again and add wet ingredients to dry ingredients. Stir until just combined and mix in beets. </li>
                    <li>Evenly divide batter between the muffin liners and place in the oven. Bake for 20-25 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the middle of a muffin comes out clean. Immediately remove muffins from muffin tin and place on a cooling
                        rack. Enjoy!
